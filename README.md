# KoreaTripHelper
This program supports membership functions, and has information on restaurants, attractions, and accommodations in Korea. Also, in this program, reservations can be made about accommodation.

# Databases
<br>This program uses a local database, and uses MySQL for JDBC. Therefore, you need to change the address and id value at the top of every .java file.

# Database Tables
<br>For smooth program execution, you should create a table named gifticon, member, reserve2, stay, stay1, stay2.
The information of each table is the same as the picture.
